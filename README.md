# ambassador-eval.

The ambassador-eval. consists on a simple 2 stage evaluation for the **Ambassador Program** project.

Its main goal consists in understanding how the developer approaches multiple problems together, seeking the most suitable solution for each one of them.  

## Stages

As mentioned above, we will be going over 2 stages:

#### 1. Open-discussion topics

**What:** It consists in 3 points about project development that should be discussed openly. There's no right answer when we come to this questions, they are based on past experiences and personal opinion.

**Why:** Helps to understand how the developer see and shares his point-of-view over a specific topic, helping both parts in evolving together.

#### 2. App development

**What:** Development of a small application that goes over some core points of the project that will be developed. Being, something developed from scratch, no limits or boundaries will be applied - letting the developer chose which technologies and strategies to be used.

**Why:** More than evaluating any code writing capacities, it's important to understand how the developer projects and solves the challenge that he has been faced with. Predicting problems and making the right time estimations are key for any product creation and they'll always be fundamental.

## Keynotes  

1. We can't call this a test as we aren't really testing anything.
2. Time estimations should always be close to pessimist rather than optimist.
3. Freedom is given at every moment.
4. More important than the solution, is the path crossed.
5. At any moment, if a problem arrives, you have me 24/7 available - it's the first moment we'll be working as a team!

## Open-discussion

1. When developing a React app, sometimes we get stuck in some performance issues (e.g: rendering huge lists of data; taking 10s to write a letter on an input, etc..) or the component isn't updating, knowing that **we are calling the setter** in the place we want. Which kind of strategies could we use to solve this issues and how?

2. Choosing the right database is fundamental for the initial definition of the project. When and why would we choose SQL over NoSQL or vice-versa?

3. How would we define the right project architecture and which concepts would be then applied into that same design, knowing the we are mostly seeking scalability, maintainability and a great DX?

4. When developing an API, how would we structure it and define rules of documentation that can be followed, no matter how it grows?

## App development  

The goal is to develop a simple shoes online shop. This can all be done in a single page where are able to view all the shoes. Upon clicking in one of them, we should be able to open a small pop-up where we can eventually see the picture bigger and have more information about sizes, colors and if it is in stock or not.

The user can also add, directly from the shoes grid or in this modal, to the cart.

On the cart, we can let the user proceed to a fake payment page, where he connects his account and automatically fills all his information.

This information should come from a profile page, that can be opened as a pop-up too, by clicking on an icon, where the user can change his data. 
Upon clicking **"Pay"**, the shoe should be removed from the stock and added to the user **Inventory**.

#### Technical Points

 1. For the frontend, use any architecture or structure you feel comfortable with.
 2. If you feel okay with, use a SQL database.
 3. The developed API needs to have Authorization associated. You can use any strategy but nothing complex is necessary.


#### Notes:

 1. You can design it, follow a template or use any from a components lib.
 2. Any technology can be used.
 3. Fundamental to give a good time estimation for the project.
